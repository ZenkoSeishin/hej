        <h1>AATROX</h1>
        <h2>THE DARKIN BLADE</h2>
        <h3>
          Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void, Aatrox and his
          brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra,
          and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after centuries
          of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more,
          corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the
          magical weapon that contained his essence. Now, with stolen flesh, he
          walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form,
          seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.
        </h3>

  <h1>Playstyle:Bruiser</h1>
<h2>Umbral Dashâ€™s passive turns bloody teamfights into fonts of health, keeping Aatrox alive for as long as his carnage continues. Allies who shield and sustain him for more swings of The Darkin Blade will be rewarded with a frontline juggernaut who can take as much damage as he deals. Wary enemies will try to slay the darkin before his Blood Well fills, but even death cannot halt his warpath once Aatrox transforms with World Ender. Flee, or die.</h2>
